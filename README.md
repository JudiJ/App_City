# Readme App_City

This project contains the application files for a gamified VR environment. 

It was developed for the 2023/24 study "In Rod we Trust - The evaluation of virtual Rod and Frame Test as a cybersickness screening instrument" by J. Josupeit.

To check out and download the original Unity scene and the programming scripts for the custom created assets, go to [City_Project](https://github.com/JudiJ/City_Project).

Download the zip-file in this project to get the full playable VR application with the Unity Player.

## The Application 
“City.exe” runs the program for a freely explorable virtual city environment. For gamification, glowing green checkpoints can be collected by virtually walking through them. 

The application file should open in Windows, Linux, and MacOS. 

This project was programmed for the HTC Vive controllers. The application should work independently from the hardware, but other HMDs may have limited functionality. Oculus devices should have full visuals, but no controller connection.

### Functions
- menu with a text bar to insert a participant number
- dark waiting room while the menu is open, before the virtual city is displayed
- collectable checkpoints
- option to reset main camera to starting position with or without displaying the waiting room again
- application ended by right clicking with the mouse or closing the window
- each trial can be recorded: the recorded time stamps follow the format yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss:fffff

## Project Layout
The first files in this project are the "City.exe" application, the key and controller bindings, and the Unity Player and Crash Handler. Additionally, this project also includes two folders:

- [City_Data](https://github.com/JudiJ/Application_City/tree/main/City_Data) contains the game managing files, the default and custom built-in Unity resources, plugins, as well as global game manager, resources and shared assets.
  - the sub-folder [Managed](https://github.com/JudiJ/Application_City/tree/main/City_Data/Managed) contains the dll-files for the application
- [MonoBleedingEdge](https://github.com/JudiJ/Application_City/tree/main/MonoBleedingEdge) contains autogenerated information by Unity

### Supplementary
Unity game engine version v2019.1.11f1. Steam VR Assets of the Winridge City Assets (version 2.3.2) enhanced with custom-designed features. Custom assets created using Blender version 2.90.

The application was originally run with a Windows 10 (64 bit) computer, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 GPU and Intel Core i7-9700K processor.
