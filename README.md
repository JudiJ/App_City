# Application_City

This project contains the files for a gamified VR-application in a virtual city. It was developed for the 2022/23 experiment "Replication of Field-Dependency and Cybersickness" by J. Josupeit, L. Greim, and S. Sanchez Rivas.

“City.exe” runs the program for the virtual City environment. Participants can freely explore the environment by pressing the middle of the trackpad on the controller with their thumb. The camera will accelerate linearly up to a consistent movement speed of 7 fps (2.1336 m/s). For a gamified task, the participants can collect glowing green Checkpoints by moving through them. Ending the application automatically saves the recorded data in a separately created folder.

After loading the application, a menu opens to a text bar to insert the participant number. Press “enter” on the numbpad to close the menu and start the recording. End the application by right clicking the mouse or by closing the window with the cursor. Closing the application automatically saves the recorded data.
The recorded time stamps follow the format yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss:fffff.

The exe-application should open in Windows, Linux, MacOS, indiscriminately. 
This project was built for the HTC Vive and the key commands only have bindings to the Vive controllers. The application should work independly from the hardware, but other HMDs may have limited functionality. Oculus devices should have full visuals, but no controller connection.

The Unity game engine version is v2019.1.11f1, Steam VR Assets were used (Version 2.3.2). The application was originally run with a Windows 10 (64 bit) computer, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 GPU and Intel Core i7-9700K processor.

The folder “City_Data” contains the game managing files, assets, plugins, as well as Unity resources. The separate folder "Managed" contains the dynamic link library files for the application.

The project also contains the folder "MonoBleedingEdge" generated by Unity.
