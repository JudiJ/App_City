# Application_City

This project contains the files for a gamified VR-application in a virtual city. It was developed for the 2022/23 experiment "Replication of Field-Dependency and Cybersickness" by J. Josupeit, L. Greim, and S. Sanchez Rivas.

### Application 
“City.exe” runs the program for the virtual City environment. Participants can freely explore the environment by pressing the middle of the trackpad on the controller with their thumb. The camera will accelerate linearly up to a consistent movement speed of 7 fps (2.1336 m/s). For a gamified task, the participants can collect glowing green Checkpoints by moving through them. 

After opening the application, it will first show a menu with a text bar to insert the participant number. Press “enter” on the numbpad to close the menu and start recording. End the application by right clicking the mouse or by closing the window with the cursor. Closing the application automatically saves the recorded data in a separately created folder.
The recorded time stamps follow the format yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss:fffff.

The exe-application should open in Windows, Linux, MacOS, indiscriminately. 
This project was built for the HTC Vive and the key commands only have bindings to the Vive controllers. The application should work independently from the hardware, but other HMDs may have limited functionality. Oculus devices should have full visuals, but no controller connection.

### File Management
The application "City.exe", the Unity player and Unity crash handler, as well as the key and controller bindings are saved in the first hierarchy of the project. Aside from the files this project also includes the two folders "City_Data" and "MonoBleedingEdge":

- The folder “City_Data” contains the game managing files, assets, plugins, as well as Unity resources. The sub-folder "Managed" contains the dll files for the application

- The folder "MonoBleedingEdge" contains autogenerated information by Unity

### Supplementary
The Unity game engine version is v2019.1.11f1. Steam VR Assets of the Winridge City Assets were used (Version 2.3.2) and enhanced with custom-designed features. The application was originally run with a Windows 10 (64 bit) computer, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 GPU and Intel Core i7-9700K processor.
