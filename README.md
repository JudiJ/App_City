# Readme App_City

This project contains the application "City.exe" for a gamified VR environment. It was developed for the 2023/24 study "In Rod we Trust - The evaluation of virtual Rod and Frame Test as a cybersickness screening instrument" by J. Josupeit.

To check out and download the original Unity scene and the programming scripts for the custom created assets, go to [City_Project](https://github.com/JudiJ/City_Project).

In addtion to downloading the zip-folder, requriements are Unity (v2019.1.11f1), Steam VR, and for the interaction a HTC Vive controller. 

## The Application 
After unpacking the zip-folder the “City.exe” will start in Windowed mode. Users can explore a virtual city environment freely and find glowing green checkpoints on their way. In order to collect them users need to walk through them. 

The application file should open in Windows, Linux, and MacOS. This project was programmed for the HTC Vive controllers. The application should work independently from the head-mounted display, but other custom key bindings will be required for the virtual locomotion (e.g. Oculus devices should have full visuals, but no interaction possibilities).

### Functions
- GUI with an input field to insert a participants code [enabeled by pressing enter on the numpad]
- dark waiting room, before and after the virtual city is displayed [enabeled and disabeled by pressing 0 on the numpad]
- collectible checkpoints
- option to reset the main camera to the starting position with  [enabeled by pressing 0 on the numpad] or without displaying the waiting room again  [enabeled by pressing escape]
- application ends by right clicking with the mouse or closing the window
- each trial is automatically recorded in a CSV file (the delimiter is "/" the decimal separator is ",")  after confirmation of the entered participant's code: 
  - The following information will be logged every frame:
    - the system-time ("yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss:fffff")
    - the number of collected checkpoints
    - whether the city (even number) or the waiting room (odd number) is displayed
    - the input on the x- and y-axis of the controller
    - the position and rotation of the virtual camera in global Unity coordinates

## Project Layout
The first files in this project are the "City.exe" application, the key and controller bindings, and the Unity Player and Crash Handler. Additionally, this project also includes two folders:

- [City_Data](https://github.com/JudiJ/Application_City/tree/main/City_Data) contains the game managing files, the default and custom built-in Unity resources, plugins, as well as global game manager, resources and shared assets.
  - the sub-folder [Managed](https://github.com/JudiJ/Application_City/tree/main/City_Data/Managed) contains the dll-files for the application
- [MonoBleedingEdge](https://github.com/JudiJ/Application_City/tree/main/MonoBleedingEdge) contains autogenerated information by Unity

### Supplementary
Unity game engine version v2019.1.11f1, Steam VR Asset (version 2.3.2) enhanced with custom-designed features. 

The application was originally run with a Windows 10 (64 bit) computer, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 GPU and Intel Core i7-9700K processor.
